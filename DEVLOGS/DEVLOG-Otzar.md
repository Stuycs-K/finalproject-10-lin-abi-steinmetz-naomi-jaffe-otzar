### 2025-05-14 - Research
Reading an article about different types of audio stenography.

### 2025-05-15 - Research
Classwork: Reading about WAV files and the basics of audio stenography.
Homework: Working on proposal.

### 2025-05-16 - Out of school (very sick)
Homework: Sick all weekend

### 2025-05-19 - Proposal + Decode
Classwork: Gave everyone different role and determine a timeline. I'm working on the decode function. Started the decode file.
Homework: Working on the decode file

### 2025-05-20 - Debugging
Classwork: Working to debug the decode - right now it is only outputing binary for some reason.
Homework: More debugging

### 2025-05-21 - Finished Debugging the LSB decode
Classwork: AP Exam
Homework: Finished debugging and merged with main

### 2025-05-22 - Finished up decode and researching extensions
Classwork: AP Exam
Homework: Research

### 2025-05-23 - Working on phase coding
Classwork: Trying to understand this https://ijarcce.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/11_LSB-Modification-and-Phase-Encoding-Technique-of-Audio-Steganography-Revisited.pdf
Homework: Started on the phase coding: split apart the audio and decoded the audio into the right text format

### 2025-05-27 - Still confused on how phase coding works
Classwork: Reviewing a code example and trying to figure out exactly what each numpy function does to see how it works exactly.
Homework: Watching a YT video to understand better.

### 2025-05-28 - Continuing working and debugging
Classwork: Encoding function

### 2025-05-29 - Chunks
Getting the chunks to work right. Doing some debugging because it would not run without errors. Both classwork and homework.

### 2025-05-30 - Reconstructing the audio
Classwork: Working on using the ifft and the other functions to get the audio back into a listenable state.
Homework: Working out the bugs and working on the encode code more

### 2025-06-02 - Encode
FINALLY GOT THE ENCODE WORKING that was close.
Didn't understand the final part of the tutorial at first but then I realized that it meant to literally put 1j.
