# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Abigail Lin, Naomi Steinmetz, Otzar Jaffe
       
# Intentions:

We're building a python script that can encode and decode UTF-8 text into WAV audio files using least-significant bit replacement (LSB). Our goal is to show how simple messages can be encoded into audio files without them sounding audibly different to the human ear.

# Intended usage:

Users will be able to interact via the command line (through the system args).

Example
```
python audio.py encode in.wav out.wav file_name_message
python audio.py decode out.wav
```

# Technical Details:

- audio stegnography, bitwise operations (manipulation), encode/decode,

Our project includes audio stegnography using LSB, which will require bitwise manipulation to encode and decode secret messages.

Abigail and Naomi are working on encode.py, as well as exploring extra features to be included into the design. Otzar is working on decode.py. Afterwards, all of us will collaberate on slides and creating the video.

(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include: 
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
     
How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
