# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Abigail Lin, Naomi Steinmetz, Otzar Jaffe
       
# Intentions:

We're building a python script that can encode and decode UTF-8 text into WAV audio files using least-significant bit replacement (LSB). Our goal is to show how simple messages can be encoded into audio files without them sounding audibly different to the human ear.

# Intended usage:

Users will be able to interact via the command line (through the system args).

Example
```
python audio.py encode in.wav out.wav file_name_message
python audio.py decode out.wav
```

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
  
    
# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
